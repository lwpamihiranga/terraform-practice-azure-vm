# Deploying Azure VM using Terraform

This is a practice project I did to learn Terraform by deploying a fully working Azure VM to the cloud with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)

### Learning Resources

* [Terraform Course Video - freeCodeCamp](https://youtu.be/SLB_c_ayRMo)
* [Terraform Azure Provider Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs)
* [Azure Docs - Creating Linux VM with Terraform](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/developer/terraform/create-linux-virtual-machine-with-infrastructure)

> Note - SSH key for the VM will be outputted to the console after the VM is up. Copy the key and save it using .pem format for further use
